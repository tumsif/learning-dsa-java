# Learning DSA (Data structure and algorithm)

Hi, ðŸ˜Š I am Tumsifu Lema. Welcome to my repository

This repository has some of what i learnt when studing Data structures and algorithm.
It doesnt cover much but since you visited this repository have a look.

## To compile
*(Tested on Linux) - I dont know about you Windows folks.* ðŸ¤£

`./compile` to convert your application to jar file

## To Run the script
`./run` runs the script

But make sure you allow the excecutable permissions to this two using command

`sudo chmod u+x compile run`

## Algorithm and Data Structure
- An algorithm is a high level, language independent description of a step by step process of performing a task.

- A Data structure is a specific family of algorithms for implementing an abstract data type.

- Abstract data type is a mathematical description of an object with set of operations on the object.

### Abstract Data type
Is a data declaration packaged together with operations that are meaningful for the data type.

It encapsulates the data and operations on the data, and then hidden from the user.

Since it uses abstraction under the hood.
This means
- We know what a data type can do.
- How it is done is hidden for the user

With an ADT users are not concerned with how a task is done but rather with what it can do.

Examples of ADT
- Lists [see more](./tz/ac/udsm/dsa/lists/about.md)
- Stacks [see more](./tz/ac/udsm/dsa/stacks/about.md)
- Queues [see more](./tz/ac/udsm/dsa/queues/about.md)
- Trees
- Heaps
- Graphs
