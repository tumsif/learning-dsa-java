# Learning DSA (Data structure and algorithm)

Hi, ðŸ˜Š I am Tumsifu Lema. Welcome to my repository

This repository has some of what i learnt when studing Data structures and algorithm.
It doesnt cover much but since you visited this repository have a look.

## To compile
*(Tested on Linux) - I dont know about you Windows folks.* ðŸ¤£

`./compile` to convert your application to jar file

## To Run the script
`./run` runs the script

But make sure you allow the excecutable permissions to this two using command

`sudo chmod u+x compile run`
